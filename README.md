# Shortest Path Finder

This project provides a Python implementation for finding all paths and the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted, undirected graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, and the solution finds the shortest path using a brute-force approach that explores all possible paths.

## Features

- **Find all paths**: The program recursively explores all possible paths between two nodes.
- **Find shortest path**: It identifies the shortest path based on the sum of edge weights.
- **Visualization**: The graph and the shortest path are visualized using `matplotlib` to represent the nodes and edges graphically.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Define the graph**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where the keys are node names, and the values are dictionaries with neighboring nodes as keys and edge weights as values. Here's an example graph:

```python
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}
```

2. **Run the shortest path function**: Call the `shortest_path_from_all_paths` function with the graph, start node, and end node:

```python
start, end = 'A', 'D'
path, distance = shortest_path_from_all_paths(graph, start, end)
print(f"Shortest path from {start} to {end} is {path} with distance {distance}")
```

3. **Visualize the graph and shortest path**: The program will automatically visualize the graph, including the shortest path, using `matplotlib`.

## Example

```bash
Shortest path from A to D is ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'] with distance 4.0
```

The graph visualization will show the nodes and edges, with the shortest path highlighted in blue.

## Code Explanation

1. **`find_all_paths`**: This recursive function finds all possible paths from the start node to the end node. It tracks the path and the distances between nodes as it explores the graph.
   
2. **`shortest_path_from_all_paths`**: This function calls `find_all_paths` to generate all possible paths and then selects the path with the smallest total distance.

3. **Visualization**: The `matplotlib` library is used to visualize the graph. Nodes are represented as scatter points, and edges are drawn as dashed lines. The shortest path is highlighted in blue.
